  <h2>WEB이란 무엇인가?</h2>
  <p>A website (also written as web site) is a collection of web pages and related content that is identified by a common domain name and published on at least one web server.
    Notable examples are wikipedia.org, google.com, and amazon.com.</p>

  <p>All publicly accessible websites collectively constitute the World Wide Web.
    There are also private websites that can only be accessed on a private network, such as a company's internal website for its employees.</p>
