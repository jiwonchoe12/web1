  <h2>JavaScript이란 무엇인가?</h2>
  <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
    JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.
    It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.</p>

  <p>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.
    Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,often incorporating third-party libraries.
    All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.</p>
